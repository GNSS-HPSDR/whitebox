ADF4351 VCO with Integrated PLL
===============================

The ADF4351 is an IC that provides the variable frequency local oscillator. It is a Phase Lock Loop, with an integrated Voltage Controlled Oscillator.  These are for the RF transceiver's transmit image-reject-up-converter and receiver mixer.

The IC is controlled via a 4-wire SPI-like serial interface.  It has a write only register file which controls features of the IC.  For reading, there is a digital lock detect pin, and a multiplexed analog pin connected to test points in the Phase Lock Loop.
