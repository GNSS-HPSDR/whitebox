Headless CW Transceiver
=======================

In this example you'll setup your Whitebox kit to behave as a CW transceiver.
You'll connect a potentiometer to an ADC to change the frequency, a 4-digit
seven segment display over I2C to show the frequency, a speaker via a PWM,
and a keyer using a button.
